#### Enhancements implemented

**Enhancements**:
1. Methods to display messages to users and keep outputs consistent
2. Summary Feature for Resources
3. Edit feature for Events
4. Status of attribute for resources


**Details:**

**1. Edit feature for Events**

Main implementation: `EventEditCommand` class

Implemented the **eventedit** feature for all events.

Edit feature supports editing:
- **For all events:**
- Able to edit any attribute of the event other than the assigned ID:
  - Title
  - Date
  - Description

Implemented validation and error checking for EventEditCommand, which prevents changing of any attribute of no new changes were input. 
In that scenario, prints message to user to say that no attributes were changed


**2. Status attribute for Resources**

Main implementation: `getStatus()`, `setStatus()` in `Resource` class

Implemented methods in Resource class which sets the status of the resource when executing `addCommand` (defaults to AVAILABLE when no input is given). 
This attribute indicates the status of the resource. To do so, an enumerator was created.

**3. Summary feature**

Main implementation: `SummaryCommand` class

Implemented the **summary** feature.

Summarises all resources that are currently in the database by item type and helpfully displays it into a bar graph for easy viewing.

Also summarises all events, shows the total number of events and shows the 3 upcoming events in order. 

**4. Help Command**

Main implementation: `HelpCommand` class

Allows users to key in "help" so give the users a basic understanding of the commands available as well as to lead the users to the User Guide for more information

**5. Exit Command**

Main implementation: `ExitCommand` class

Implemented the **exit** feature to allow the user to exit the program safely.
Prints a message to the user to indicate that they are exiting the program.
